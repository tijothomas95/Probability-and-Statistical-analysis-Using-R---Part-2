# Probability-and-Statistics-Using-R---Part-2
In today's fast-paced world sleep is not only a biological necessity but also a physiological drive, though, a good night's sleep is often the primary thing to go. The impacts of inadequate sleep are more than mere annoyances: they affect our mood as well as the performance in daily life. The analysis undergone in this part of assignment is concerned with finding the most significant parameters to response variable and generating a hypothetical model of the relationship between the outcome variable and  several predictos.  The initial exploration in Part I of this assignment was focused on identifying factors, which influence problems in sleep and finding those related paramaters that impact the average hours of sleep during week night. The initial analysis found that factors such as age, hourwend and trubslp all had a small but significant contribution toward a average hours of sleep/ weeknight and sleep problems. This paper will continue and build upon that analysis identifying additional factors, which contribute towards finding those predictors which are most significant and then combining all investigated factors to build a multiple linear regression model capable of predicting average hours of sleep/ weeknight*(hourwnit)*.
